# Spam-Classification

* Introduction

In this project , we are using the spam detection dataset and create the machine learning model to predict whether the given text is spam or not.

The dataset is available in kaggle ::

The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.
